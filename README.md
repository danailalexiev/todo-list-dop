# todo-list-dop

The demo presentation used for the 2025: A Java Odyssey talk for dev.bg.

The app tries to demonstrate how to use records, sealed classes and pattern matching to implement the basic principles of Data-Oriented Programming.

## Branches

* feat/refactor-using-records - replaces a mutable class with a record, ensuring immutability
* feat/refactor-using-sealed-classes - models the different variants of Tasks using a closed hierarchy implemented through a sealed interface. The business logic is based on pattern matching.
